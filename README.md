👋🏻 I’m a PhD researcher at ETH Zürich focused on low-latency, efficient machine learning systems—especially those deployable on constrained hardware like embedded platforms. Alongside my academic work, I consult as an AI engineer, helping organizations build practical and optimized ML pipelines based on LLMs. During my Master studies, I collaborated with Federico Tombari’s group at Google, working on differentiable rendering, graph-based transformers, and diffusion models. My broader research interests include real-time perception and efficient computing.
